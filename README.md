# T460s-CLOVER
A sample clover efi for the Lenovo T460s
- Based on nicogig's repo: https://github.com/nicogig/T460s-Clover
- nicogig's repo Based on tluck's repo: https://github.com/tluck/Lenovo-T460-Clover

# Hardware
Lenovo Thinkpad T460s
- Intel i7-660U
- 12GB DDR4 RAM
- HD Graphics 520
- 500 GB SanDisk SSD
- BROADCOM BCM943602BAED_2 DW1830 Wireless Card

## What's different from nicogig/tluck's Clover config
- Remove unused clover patches
- use dw1830 instead of dw1820a/dw1560

## What's not working (for me)
- SD Card reader
- Physical mouse buttons

## Credit
Thanks to tluck, nicogig and the complete hackintosh scene
